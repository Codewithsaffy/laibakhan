 <h1>Mountains</h1> 
 <h2>Types of Mountains</h2>
 <p>Mountains can be classified into different types.</p>
 <h3>1- Fold Mountains</h3>
 <p> Formed by the collision of tectonic plates that cause the Earth's crust to fold. These are the most common type of mountain.</p>

 <h3>2- Volcanic Mountains</h3>
 <p> Formed by volcanic activity when molten rock (magma) from beneath the Earth's surface erupts, cools, and piles up.</p>

 <h3>3- Dome Mountains</h3>
 <p> Created when magma pushes the Earth's crust upward, but does not break through the surface. The uplifted rock forms a dome shape.</p>

 <h3>4- Plateau Mountains</h3>
 <p>Formed by erosion rather than tectonic activity. Plateaus are raised flat areas that are eroded over time into mountain-like formations.</p>

 <h3>5- Fault-Block Mountains</h3>
 <p> Created when large areas of Earth's crust break and move along faults, leading to blocks of crust being uplifted or tilted.</p>
